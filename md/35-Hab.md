#### Chapter 1

>  **1** The vision
which Ambakum the prophet saw.

  
*Ambakum*  
 **2** How long, O Lord shall I
cry, and thou not hearken? How long shall I being injured cry to thee, and thou
not save? **3** Why hast thou pointed out to me to behold labours and sorrows,
misery and impiety? A suit is instituted against me and the judge receiveth
*bribes*  **4** therefore law is disregarded and the cause is not brought to an
issue. Because a wicked man oppresseth the just, therefore wrong judgment will
be given.

  
*Jehovah*  
 **5** See ye despisers! and view intently and be
amazed at wonderful things and vanish. For in your days I am doing a work which
you will not believe though one tell you. **6** For lo! I am raising up the
Chaldeans that bitter and hasty nation, which marcheth over the breadth of the
earth, to possess dwellings which belong not to them. **7** He is terrible and
illustrious; his judgment will be from himself, and from himself his prophesy
will proceed. **8** His horses can out leap leopards and are swifter than the
lynxes of Arabia. When his horsemen have mounted, they will rush impetuously
from afar, and will fly like an eagle, eager for prey. **9** Destruction will
come on the wicked who set themselves against him; and he will gather captives
like the sand. **10** He indeed will riot in kings; and petty princes will be
his scorn. Of every fortress he will make a scoff and will raise a mount and
take it. **11** Then he will change his mind and depart and be pacified.
*Ambakum*  
 **12** This is the majesty which belongeth to my God. Art not thou
from everlasting? Lord, my God, my Holy One! let us not die. Thou, Lord, hast
appointed this for judgment: and formed it that its correction may work
conviction in me. **13** Thine eye is too pure to behold wicked deeds, or to
look on the labours of sorrow. Why lookest thou upon despisers? Wilt thou be
silent when the wicked swallow up the righteous? **14** Wilt thou make these
men like the fishes of the sea, and like those reptiles which have no leader?
**15** He hath drawn up destruction with a hook, and hath dragged out one with
a dredge, and enclosed another with his sweep net. For this cause he will
rejoice and his heart will be glad; **16** therefore he will sacrifice to his
net and burn incense to his dredge. Because by these he made his mess rich and
his food delicious, **17** shall he on the account of this cast his dredge, and
not spare to slay nations continually?

#### Chapter 2

 **1** I will stand on
my watch and go up upon a rock and look around, that I may see what he will say
to me and what answer I shall receive to my expostulation.

  
*Jehovah*
**2** And the Lord answered and said, Write a vision: write it distinctly in a
book that the reader may trace these things; **3** for the vision is for a time
yet to come. But it will spring up at last and will not be vain. Though he may
tarry, wait for him; for he will assuredly come and will not fail. **4** If any
one draw back my soul hath no pleasure in him. But the just shall live by faith
in me.

 **5** Now this arrogant and contemptuous man--this man of boasts shall
not exceed a certain bound. He enlarged his soul like Hades and like death was
not satisfied. When he shall have gathered to him all the nations and received
for himself all the peoples, **6** will they not all take up a parable against
him and a fable to tell of him, saying, Woe to him who is heaping up for
himself things which do not belong to him? For how long? And making his yoke
grievously heavy. **7** For biters of him shall start up suddenly. And the
plotters against thee shall be sober and thou shalt be plunder for them. **8**
Because thou hast plundered many nations, all the remaining peoples shall
plunder thee for the blood of mankind, and for the impieties of a land and a
city and of all them who inhabit it. **9** Woe to him who coveteth wicked gain
for his house, that he **10** may raise his nest high to be out of the reach of
evils. Thou hast contrived shame for thy house; thou hast provoked many **11**
peoples and thy soul hath sinned; for a stone out of a wall will cry out, and a
Worm from a beam will proclaim these things.

 **12** Woe to him who buildeth a
city with blood and furbisheth up a city with iniquities! **13** Are not these
things from the Lord Almighty? When many nations have fainted by fire, and many
peoples have been dispirited, **14** that the earth may be filled with a
knowledge of the glory of God. Like water it will cover them.

 **15** Woe to
him who maketh his neighbour drink a foamy intoxicating draught, making him
drunk that he may inspect his caves. **16** Because of thy glory drink thou
also a full draught of dishonour, and be confounded at heart and shaken. The
cup of the right hand of the Lord is come round to thee and dishonour is heaped
upon thy glory. **17** For the impiety at Libanus shall cover thee and the
sufferings of wild beasts shall terrify thee, on the account of the blood of
mankind, and for the wickedness of a land and a city and of all them who
inhabit it. **18** Of what avail is a graven thing, that they have engraved it?
Did one cause a molten mass, a false fantasy, to be cast, because the caster
had a confidence that by casting he would make dumb idols? **19** Woe to him
who saith to Wood, Awake; arise. And to stone, be thou exalted. The one is
indeed a fantasy; and the other, a plating of gold and silver: there is no
breath in it. **20** But the Lord is in his holy temple. Let all the earth be
awed at his presence.

#### Chapter 3

>  **1** The Prayer of Ambacum the
prophet; with an Ode.

 **2** Lord, I have heard the report of thee and am
terrified; I have considered thy works and am struck with amaze. In the midst
of two living beings thou wilt be known; when the years draw nigh thou wilt be
acknowledged; when the time is come thou wilt be pointed out: when my soul is
troubled, in wrath remember mercy. **3** God will come from Thaiman, even the
Holy One from the thick shady mountains of Pharan. **4** His glory obscured the
heavens; and the earth was full of his praise. His splendor will be like light
--beaming rays in his hands, which impressed a lasting love of his majesty.
**5** Before him Logos *the word* will march, and advance into the plain. **6**
He stood and the earth was shaken: he looked, and nations melted away: the
mountains were violently convulsed, the everlasting hills melted. **7** Instead
of labours I beheld his marches of old. The dwellings of the Ethiopians shall
be terrified! And the tents of the land of Madian! **8** Wast thou, Lord, angry
with the rivers? Or was thy wrath against the rivers? Or thine indignation
against a sea, that thou shouldst mount thy horses? Thy riding is indeed
salvation. **9** Thou hast bent thy bow effectually against sceptres. The Lord
saith, "The land of rivers shall be broken; **10** peoples shall see and be in
pangs." Thou art scattering the rolling waters. The deep roared. It swelled
high. **11** The sun was withdrawn: and the moon stood on its orbit. Thy bolts
will glance for light, for a glare of the lightening of thine arms. **12** With
a threat thou canst diminish a land, and with wrath crush nations. **13** Thou
hast marched forth for the salvation of thy people, to save thine anointed One.
Thou wilt pour death on the head of transgressors, thou hast raised chains up
to the neck. **14** Thou hast struck with consternation the heads of mighties,
at this they will be appalled! They will slacken their reins and be like a poor
man eating in secret, **15** whilst thou art pressing into the sea thy horses
ruffling a mighty water.

 **16** I watched myself; and at the sound of the
prayer of my lips my bowels trembled and a tremor seized my bones; and under me
my whole frame quivered. I shall be at rest in the day of affliction, at the
time of his coining to the people of my neighbourhood. **17** Since the fig
tree will not flourish, nor will there be fruit on the vines; the product of
the olive will fail and the fields will supply no food--For want of food the
flocks have failed, and there are no kine in the stalls; **18** As for me, I
will rejoice in the Lord; I shall have joy for God my saviour. **19** The Lord
God is my strength, and will guide my feet to the end. He maketh me walk in
high places; that I may triumph with his song.
